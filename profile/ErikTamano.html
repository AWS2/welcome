    <h1>Erik Tamaño</h1>
    <p>My name is Erik Tamaño. <br>
        I'm 19 years old. <br>
        My house is in Cornellà de Llobregat, and I am not married. <br>
        I work as an employee for Industry Labs, and I get home every day by 10 PM at the latest. I occasionally smoke, and I like going out to drink. <br>
        I'm in bed by 12 AM or later, no matter what. <br>
        I usually have no problems sleeping until morning, but I wake up fatigued and extremely stressed in the morning. <br>
        I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. <br>
        I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life, but I am a very intense person <br>
        That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. <br>
        Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
