# Welcome Project IETI

This is a *first contact* git project for students at IETI (Institut Esteve Terradas i Illa) in Cornellà de Llobregat (or for anyone else that likes it by simply forking the repo).

## Install

You can download the project doing:

    $ git clone https://github.com/AWS2/welcome
    $ cd welcome

If you have PHP installed in your system, you can start the PHP embedded mini server by excecuting that inside the ``welcome`` folder:

    $ php -S 0.0.0.0:8080

Then you will be able to see the website in http://localhost:8080


## First GIT project

As a student, you simply have to **add** 2 files in the project. One for a picture of you (or whatever avatar you like) and a presentation in HTML of you.

You are welcome to add any improvements to the PHP code if you feel like doing it.

## Folders and filenames

- `img` folder : your picture in JPG format. The filename will be used to display your name. Choose it appropriately.
- `profile` folder : your presentation in HTML format. The **filename** have to match the one of the picture (without extension).

For instance, you could add your picture ``myperson.jpg`` in the ``ìmg`` folder and then add your description ``myperson.html`` in the ``profile``folder.


> IMPORTANT NOTE: **anyone who overwrites another person's file will be 
qualified with ZERO** '0' in this task. So, please be nice.


If you want to add some more presentation here in the README file, you may take a look to the [Markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/).
